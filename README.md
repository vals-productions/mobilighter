# Mobilighter

This document is under initial development.

Mobilighter is a lightweight project that bridges some basic user interface (and not only) functions between Android and iOS platforms because of ```J2ObjC``` code translation standard compliance. It lets you dive deeper into your platform independent coding with less need to implement platform specific coding.

Using Java as your primary coding language
you can get or set widget's text value without dealing with platform specific clases such as ```UILabel``` or ```TextView```. You can attach action listener to a button, process click events, ask user questions by displaying popup windows and proceed according to user inputs. ```J2ObjC``` translated code will perform identically or similarly on iOS.

Mobilighter will use platform specific widgets based on whether your code runs on Android or iOS. 

## Demo

You can see examples of repository usage in SQLighter demo projects for Android and iOS platforms.
